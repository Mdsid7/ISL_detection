# ISL_detection ( Indian Sign Language )

Sign language is the primary mode of communication between
hearing and vocally impaired population. The target of this research is to
experiment, iterate and recommend a system that is successful in recognition of
Indian Sign Language(ISL). It is a challenging as well as an interesting problem, as
the solution brings a leap in both social and technological aspects. We propose a
real-time recognition of ISL based on a mobile platform, to have better
accessibility and user friendly. The proposed technique uses **Transfer learning**
approach for ISL to be modelled on various pre-trained high- end models and
optimize the best model to run on a mobile platform considering the various
limitations of the same during optimization.

# PURPOSE

People with disabilities or differently able are often isolated from
accessing proper health, education and other social interactions. Deafness and
vocal impairment are one of the major disabilities faced by human beings from
centuries. This problem hinders a person from communicating in verbal languages
to the outside world leading to isolation from the rest of the major verbally
communicating society. Hearing impaired and deaf people use signs to
communicate with others. Just like verbally spoken languages, there is no universal
language, as every country has its own spoken language so every country has its
own dialect of sign language. In India, **Indian Sign Language(ISL)** is used by the
hearing and vocally impaired community.

# METHOD

The proposed method uses **Transfer Learning** which makes the process
and thus the system more robust with both large or small datasets. Training a
powerful Deep Learning model from scratch can take days at a time and requires
appreciable computational power and hardware, while Transfer Learning makes
those models flexible and they easily adapt to new data. 

Here, we have trained 2 models one is **Inception V3** and the other is **Mobilenet** for comapring which has best features and accuracy among them.
